# LegalComponents

The Computational Law research team at MIT Media Lab is starting to explore use of Web Components for the law.  An initial proof of concept focus area is using custom elements and standard templates for legal clauses (eg provisions of contracts, sections of statutes, etc). The deliberate synergy between Web Components and Material Design also seems a natural fit for improving understanding and actionability at the display layers.  

The advantages using more modern content structures and formats that come with Web Components should provide value at each lifecycle phase. Most of the initial attention in the law is on data management and workflow benefits for lawyers, legislators and other legal professionals but Web Components are especially well suited to improve downstream experience at display time to "end users".  Opportunities to routinely enhance accessible, simple, streamlined and comprehension presentation of legal content are of high value.  The integrated "user display" and "user actions" via such functional elements as buttons, menu icons and "flop the card" are key.
